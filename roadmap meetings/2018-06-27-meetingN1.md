## The ideas

The participants voted on which of the ideas they thought it worth most of our effort, they are listed below by the most voted to the least.

_It's important to mention that we didn't discarded any of the ideas, we just set our priorities based on what the participants, all of them common users of restQL, thought as top priority issues._
